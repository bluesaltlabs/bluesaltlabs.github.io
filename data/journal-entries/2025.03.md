## To Do

- [ ] Create an additive synthesizer editing tool, where the waveform and synthesis elements can be modified, then heard and seen.


## Waveforms and Synthesizers

Notes on waveforms and synthesizers.


### Frequency Modulation (FM) Synthesis

FM synths use one waveform to modulate the frequency of another waveform over time.


### Amplitude Modulation (AM) Synthesis

AM synths use one waveform to modulate the amplitude of another waveform over time.


### Phase Modulation (PM) Synthesis

PM synths use one waveform to modulate the phase of another waveform over time.


### Additive Synthesis

Additive synths build complex waveforms by combining many simple waveforms. This method operates on the principle that any complex sound can be broken down into its fundamental components (pure sine waves at various frequencies, amplitudes, and phases).
Adaptive synthesis begins with two or more simple (usually sine) input signals and outputs complex waveforms from the resulting signal combination.
This allows adding harmonics one at a time to the waveform.


### Subtractive Synthesis

Subtractive synths start with harmonically rich waveforms (like square, sawtooth, and pulse waves -  contain high harmonic complexity) and applies filters to modify waveform parameters over time. More complex effects can be created by applying oscillators and other operators to the filter effect parameters over time. These parameter modifiers can be applied with consistent frequency modulation using an oscillator (especially an LFO), or with more complex oscillation methods such as those created by an envelope generator.
Subtractive synthesis begins with complex waveforms and modifies the output signal using filters to remove or modify harmonic tones.


### Wavetable Synthesis

Wavetable synths generate complex waveforms by utilizing oscillators that employ wavetables to create complex, quasi-periodic waveforms from multiple single-cycle waveforms. This technique is accomplished by modulating through a series of single-cycle waveforms in various ways. Essentially this is a 2-dimensional version of PM/FM synthesis.

### Terms

* volume = amplitude
* operators = Oscillators
* pitch = frequency
* **Synthesis**: ...
* **Oscillator**: An electronic circuit (or software) that generates periodic waveforms as specific frequencies. This is the primary sound source of a synthesizer.
* **Periodic Waveform**: Repeating waveforms that maintain a consistent shape over time, such as the sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waves.
* **Frequency**: How often something happens in a given period of time. In audio, this is how often a waveform repeats each second measured in Hertz (1 Hertz = once per second) and determines the pitch of a sound. A high frequency sound has a high pitch, and a low frequency sound has a low pitch.
* **Amplitude**: The perceived loudness of a sound. Mathematically, it refers to the maximum distance a wave moves from its equilibrium position, and is indicative of the height of the wave. A higher amplitude corresponds with more energy being carried by the wave, and generates a louder sound than a low amplitude waveform.
* **Phase**: Each periodic waveform has a starting point in its oscillation cycle, and the _phase_ describes the point at which a periodic waveform is in its cycle at a given time, typically measured in degrees from 0 - 360. The phase relationship between two or more waveforms with identical or harmonically related periods is extremely important, and the ratio relationships between them needs more descriptive notes here.
* **Pitch**: The frequency at which a waveform oscillates.
* **Modulation**: changing operator parameters over time.
* **Modulator**: A modulator is an operator that is doing the modulating.
* **Carrier**:  A carrier is the operator that is being modulated (by the modulator).
* **Filter**: Modifies the sound by removing certain frequencies, while allowing others to pass through. Examples include low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and notch filters.
* **Envelope**: Shapes an audio signal over time.
* **Tone (Timbre)**: The distinguishing characteristic that differentiates one sound from another, despite the fact that they might be playing the same frequency at the same amplitude. (can be described as "sharp", "round", "reedy", "brassy", "bright", "dark", etc.) Kind of like the flavor of the sound.
* **Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO)**: an oscillator with a very low frequency.
* **Fundamental Frequency**: ...


### Effects

* **Tremolo**: This effect can be created by assigning an LFO to the volume parameter of a sound, creating a cyclic variation in amplitude.
* **Vibrato**: This effect can be created by assigning an LFO to the frequency parameter of a sound, creating a cyclic variation in pitch.
* **Wobble**: This effect can be created by assigning an LFO to the cut-off frequency of a filter, creating a cyclic variation in timbre.
