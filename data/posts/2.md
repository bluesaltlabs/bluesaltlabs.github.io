## The Start

This week I set out to get a blog site set up so I could begin to document the work I've been doing.
This process was only supposed to take a day or two, but like most coding projects, the actual work
took longer than expected.


## The Goal

How does one deploy a web application in the simplest way possible using modern tools?
Even for simple projects such as a portfolio site or demo project, there are a variety of hosting options to choose from. One of the most well-known services is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Two other services I'll be learning to deploy to are [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages).




... in progress, please wait.
