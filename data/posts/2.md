## The Start

This week I set out to get a blog site set up so I could begin to document the work I've been doing. This process was only supposed to take a day or two, but like most coding projects, the actual work took longer than expected.


## The Goal

How does one deploy a web application in the simplest way possible using modern tools, ideally with little to no cost? Even for simple projects such as a portfolio site or demo project, there are a variety of hosting options to choose from. One of the most well-known services is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Two other services I'll be learning to deploy to with are [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages).


## Project Setup

For this project the first step is to create an `index.html` file. Instructions on creating the HTML file can be found [all over the place](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), or you can check out the example below (or [my currently deployed version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesaltlabs/bluesaltlabs.github.io/refs/heads/main/index.html) ):

The next step is to configure git for this project. Make sure you have [git installed](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) before continuing on. Open the project in your terminal of choice and `git init`:


```bash
# Change to the project directory (replace with your project path)
cd ~/projects/bluesaltlabs/bluesaltlabs.github.io

# Initialize git
git init

# Create your first git commit
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit. Adds index file."
```

- [ ] `todo: add screenshot of the terminal doing this? not sure how the text above will render.`


## Setting Up The GitHub Project

Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com)'s website, set up an account if you don't already have one, and create a new project.


- [ ] `todo: screenshot(s) of setting up a project in GitHub.`
- [ ] `todo: explain where the project URL described below comes from.`
  - `these instructions are also displayed when setting up the new project in GitHub.`


Copy the project URL and return to your terminal. Enter the following command to add the remote to the project and push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
# Replace with your project URL
git remote add origin git@github.com:bluesaltlabs/bluesaltlabs.github.io.git
git pull origin # Or git push first? not sure
# todo: need to create the README and LICENSE files.
```



## Deploying The Project

Deploying this plain HTML file is fairly straightforward now that the project is on GitHub!

- [ ] `todo: continue explaining this process`
- [ ] `todo: add screenshots of the [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/bluesaltlabs/bluesaltlabs.github.io/settings/pages) interface setup proces`


## Next Steps

- [ ] `todo: explain how the blog pages are loading from [here](https://bluesaltlabs.github.io/data/posts/2.md)`
- [ ] `todo: explain how to deploy this to cloudflare pages, then set up DNS on another project, etc. `



... in progress, please wait.
