## The Start

This week I set out to get a blog site set up so I could begin to document the work I've been doing. This process was only supposed to take a day or two, but like most coding projects, the actual work took longer than expected.

## The Goal

How does one deploy a web application in the simplest way possible using modern tools, ideally with little to no cost? Even for simple projects such as a portfolio site or demo project, there are a variety of hosting options to choose from. One of the most well-known services is [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). Two other services I'll be learning to deploy to with are [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) and [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages).

## Project Setup

For this project the first step is to create an `index.html` file. Instructions on creating the HTML file can be found [all over the place](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), or you can check out the example below (or [my currently deployed version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluesaltlabs/bluesaltlabs.github.io/refs/heads/main/index.html) ):

The next step is to configure git for this project. Make sure you have [git installed](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) before continuing. Open the project in your terminal of choice and initialize git:

```bash
# Change to the project directory (replace with your project path)
cd ~/projects/bluesaltlabs/bluesaltlabs.github.io

# Initialize git
git init

# Create your first git commit
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit. Adds index file."
```

## Setting Up The GitHub Project

Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com)'s website, set up an account if you don't already have one, and create a new project.

Copy the project's repository URL and return to your terminal. Enter the following command to add the remote to the project and push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
# Add the remote to the repository (replace with your project URL)
git remote add origin git@github.com:bluesaltlabs/bluesaltlabs.github.io.git

# Push your changes to GitHub!
git push origin main
```

  <strong>Note</strong>: This will throw an authentication error if you don't have an SSH key set up with your github account. For more information, check out
  <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account" target="_blank">the documentation</a>.
</div>


## Deploying The Project

Deploying this plain HTML file is fairly straightforward now that the project repository is pushed to GitHub!

To deploy your new website, navigate to your repository settings. There is a "Settings" tab on the main repository page. Click this then click the "Pages" link in the left sidebar.

  </a>

Note the settings in the image above. Set the "Source" dropdown (under "Build and deployment" to "deploy from a branch"), and set the branch to "main" in the dropdown below. Leave "/(root)" alone (as the `index.html` file is located at the root of the project) and click the "Save" button.

After a few minutes, the "Visit Site" button should display at the top. You can also visit your project repository at `<github-username>.github.io` (example: [`bluesaltlabs.github.io`](https://bluesaltlabs.github.io)).

<!--
- [ ] `todo: I want to double-check the steps of this process. The exact workflow may differ slightly, but these instructions should be sufficient for now.`
-->

Congratulations! your new website should now be deployed to GitHub pages.


## Next Steps

In the next post, I will describe the steps I took to deploy this site to Cloudflare pages.
After that I'll discuss setting up DNS for a site deployed to either of these services.
Finally, I'll discuss the method used to set up this blog site. This project is retriving [blog post data](https://bluesaltlabs.github.io/data/posts/2.md) from another GitHub repository via a `fetch()` call, and I'll describe how I set this up.
