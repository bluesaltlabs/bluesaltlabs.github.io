Why was this site created? Why is the content added to this site so haphazard? In this post, I will be exploring these questions and diving into the goals and timeline of the next few months.

### Background

For as long as I can remember I have been passionate about technology, especially computers and computer software. My awareness of computer software as a concept began in the late 90s when I gained access to a windows 3.11 computer. This was an era when these beige boxes had a turbo button.

At 8 years old this was one of the coolest things I had yet encountered, and I had to learn more. One of the first things I discovered was a program called Flight Simulator. After spending some time going over the (quite large, paper) [Pilot's Handbook](https://archive.org/details/microsoft-flight-simulator-v-5-0-1993-us-pc-big-box-floppy-35/Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator%20%28v5.0%29%20%281993%29%20%28US%29_manual%5BeXoDOS%5D/) (and crashing my virtual plane many, many times), I eventually figured out how to [fly a plane](https://www.mobygames.com/game/1674/microsoft-flight-simulator-v50/screenshots/) around blocky Chicago (which at the time was [_as real as it gets_](https://archive.org/details/msdos_Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_v5.1_1993?hide_flag_warning=bad_metadata&rand=1257617943)).

Most of the other games I was able to play were either puzzle-related or educational. I was obsessed with this world that was able to capture my focus in a way that very little I had encountered before could, and I wanted to learn everything I could about where this technology came from and how it could exist.

This passion for technology was pushed by 3 major events in my life, and the aforementioned computer was the first. The second was my introduction to the world of LEGO Mindstorms robotics, and the third was the computer repair club I joined in high school called TEConnections.

TEConnections was a program that taught students computer repair skills using surplus, retired technology from the district. This work led to an internship with the district's instructional technology support center (ITSC)  for the summer after graduation.

This connection later gave me an "in" to apply for another internship with the school's CTE (career and technical education) department. This was my first programming job, and I was tasked with maintaining a C#.NET web application for students to track their volunteer and work experience. It was built by another student intern who had moved on to bigger and better things, and they needed someone to fix bugs, add features, and "own" the code-base.

At this point I was in my second year of college and had only been writing code for slightly less time than I had attended college. I had very little idea what I was doing, but I learned a huge amount about managing a code-base and communicating with users about issues they encountered for the year I worked there.

After about a year working for the CTE department I had gained enough confidence in my abilities to apply for a full-time software developer position. I dropped out of school entirely and began my first full-time programming job with Taylor Study Method.

Originally the plan was to attend school and work full time simultaneously, but I had been tasked with learning this new framework called Laravel in a new language called PHP, and there was a lot to dive into for a jQuery dev with a half-finished college degree. I knew I was probably going to burn out of school soon anyway, and I was excited to take on a real challenge instead of the abstract projects presented in an academic setting.

I learned so much in my 4+ years with this company, and am incredibly grateful for the experiences I was able to have there.

I used what I learned at TSM to move up again, this time as the lead developer rebuilding the website and other web applications for OpenEye. This was also an incredible learning experience for a lot of reasons, and I leveled up my skills even more than before.
But unfortunately, In September 2022, I was let go from this position after working there for almost 4 years.

At this point I had been a professional software developer for over 8 years, and after being let go from two companies with little to no explanation as to why, I was struggling with immense impostor syndrome and burnout. I used the time I had while on unemployment (and then some) searching for another software developer position, but was unable to find anything.

Ultimately I was forced to look for temp work, and was placed in a groundskeeping position with a retirement home. Growing up I spent quite a bit of time outdoors, so I was no stranger to hard, manual labor. That said, I was very much not prepared physically or mentally.

The sudden career field change and other life circumstances led to a very difficult 18 months of doing my best to stay afloat. I did not work on much programming during this time - in fact the burnout made it difficult to use a computer at all.

After about 18 months of this (and a lot of networking) I was offered a software developer position with CDL PowerSuite. This was a massive opportunity and I couldn't have been more thankful or excited about it.
Unfortunately, the time spent away from the computer took a much bigger toll than I had anticipated, and I was not able to maintain enough output to keep that job. I was let go at the beginning of January this year after 4 months of re-learning how to be a professional software developer.

### So What's The Point?

This is _not_ intended to be a sob-story - this is context for why this website exists.
I am on unemployment and looking for software development roles for the second time in 3 years, and my strategy needs to be different than it was last time.

I have dedicated huge portions of my life and energy working to be the best software engineer I can be, and I don't want to give that up when there is plenty of work out there still to accomplish.

That said, I recognize the need to take stock of the situation and face reality. Allowing everything else to fall apart while I focus entirely on attaining employment in one specific field is not a responsible choice to make.

So for the next few months while I am still financially able to do so, I will be practicing and studying the field I fell in love with at 8 years old and writing about my progress in this blog. Ideally this will lead to some form of employment by showcasing what I'm capable of. But if it doesn't work out and I am forced to find another form of employment to survive, then at least this project will be a testament to an effort made.

I know that is something I can be proud of.

### Conclusion

My goal over the next few months is to find work as a software developer. In the process I will be sharing what I learn and the resources I find along the way. I hope these resources are the foundation of the next stage of my career, and that they can help other people in similar situations attain their own goals.
